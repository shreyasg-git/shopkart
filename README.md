## Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is my submission for the job posting.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 13+ (with App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom JWT Authentication

### A Quick Summary

> This project is rolling JWT auth made & tested within mere 3 days time. (You can actually see the commits!)

All the pages in the app are rendered thoughtfully either on server or client. Here's a quick summary

| Route     | Rendering Style                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| /         | Server Side                         |
| /signin   | Server Side                         |
| /signup   | Server Side                         |
| /products | Server Side (sorting - client side) |
| /cart     | Server Side                         |

Additionally, it also has server-side APIs, which are called when a client component needs some data.

Apart from that, the components which use client side features are rendered client side.

I have made sure that it checks out all the requirements specified in the document.
